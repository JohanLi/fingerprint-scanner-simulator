# Fingerprint Scanner Simulator

*The Diamond Casino Heist* in GTA Online introduces two hacking minigames,
one of them being the fingerprint scanner. Mastering this minigame is essential if one
wants to maximize their take.

## MVP release

The first version of this has been released now:
https://johan.li/gta-online/fingerprint-scanner-simulator

If enough people find this simulator useful, there are a couple of TODOs:
- Tidy up the codebase. As this repo was based off another one of mine, it has excessive dependencies
and configuration.
- Reduce the amount of unnecessary rerenders.
- Get rid of the setTimeout() workaround.

## Getting started

Install latest Node, and run the following:

```
npm install
npm start
```
